# EPAiV5-Session21
Session 21 Polymorphism

![Build Status](https://github.com/aravindchakravarti/EPAiV5-Session21/actions/workflows/python-app.yml/badge.svg)


## Overview

This project implements a custom numerical type in Python called `AdvancedNumber` that demonstrates the use of Python's special methods (magic methods) and polymorphic behavior. The implementation showcases various Python programming concepts including operator overloading, custom formatting, and object lifecycle management.

## Features
### Core Functionality

- Custom numeric type with rich operator support
- Arithmetic operations (+, -, , /, %)
- Comparison operations (<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)
- Hashable objects (works in sets and as dictionary keys)
- Boolean conversion
- Callable objects (returns squared value)
- Custom string formatting
- Object lifecycle management (with destructor)
